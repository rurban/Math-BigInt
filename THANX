I wish to thank the following people:

* Mark A. Biggar and Ilya for the original versions.
* Steffen Beyer for the discussions and ideas.
* Bruce Fields for spotting bugs.
* Mark Dickinson for spotting bugs.
* HH for listening to my boring explanations.
* Peter Prymmer for spotting the OS/390 problems with / 1e5

Special thanx must go to John Peacock and Tom Roche, both have helped me a lot
in developing the latest version, not only by cheerfully kicking my lazy butt
from time to time, but also by providing advice, bug-reports, suggestions and
nagging questions, as well as bearing with my countless ranting emails. So,
thank you very much!

Also I want to thank all the ever-busy people on p5p. You guys (and gals) rock!

List is not complete ;o)
