Known bugs:

* General:
  + BigInt can not the IEEE '-0'. Currently there are no plans to add this. If
    you need it, please bug the autor(s) about it.

* BigFloat:
  + with 'Math::BigInt::Lite' does not work as of Lite v0.08. The reason
    is that BigFloat does unholy things with it's "BigInt" minion, and Lite
    isn't a proper BigInt subclass. Fixes either in Lite (slow) or BigFloat
    (slow, too).
  + comparing (<=> or == or !=) a BigFloat to a BigInt don't work yet
  + new is first running the entire number trough _split, then again the parts
    to construct BigInts. Could be a bit more optimzed.
  + fdiv() using F (fallback) mode does not work properly in all cases of
    local (aka $x's or $y's) A or P settings. Not definite test case yet, but
    it might calculate not enough digits to satisfy the rounding needs.
  
* BigInt:
  + exponent on input is limited to a Perl int (bigger numbers won't fit
    into your memory, anyway - use BigFloat)
  + doesn't have a mode akin to 'use integer;', e.g. it always emulates Perl
    (this is solved partially by use bigint ;)
  + Handling of undef arguments is somewhat broken (no proper warnings)
  + eval('use...') and use Math::BigInt qw/:constant/ fail on Perl prior 5.6.0
    This is likely an Exporter bug, and causes Math::BigInt to eval require on
    earlier Perls when loading the core math lib. Thus the loading can fail 
    under older Perls on filesystems that can not cope with the
    'Math/BigInt/Calc.pm'-style filenames.

Mixing of classes does not always work like expected. "use bignum;",
"use bigint;" and "use bigrat;" should solve this problem for most cases.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
