Rewrite project of Math::Big*

(C) Copyright ..--- ----- ----- .---- - ..--- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-

Contains new version of Math::BigInt and Math::bigFloat, so please do NOT
make 'make install', except when you do no longer want your old Math::BigInt
or know what you are doing. This rewritten version is mainly compatible, minus
some bugfixes, and more feature and more speed.

To test, unzip & untar package, then run

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install		# as root

These modules should be installed automatically into the Perl core, and not
into site-perl.
You can check whether you get the old or new versions by doing this:

	perl -MMath::BigInt -e'print "v".$Math::BigInt::VERSION,"\n";'

If it prints undef or v0.01 you still got the old version. Delete the files
from the Perl core installation path manually, and make sure that you 
delete all old versions, then try again to print the version from above. 

For a quick reference on what has changed from the old versions, please see
CHANGES. HISTORY brings you a detailed history log of the rewrite.

In ./examples are some basic example scripts.

More information including HTMLified help and benchmark results are

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
