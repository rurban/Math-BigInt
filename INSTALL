Rewrite project of Math::Big*

(C) ..--- ----- ----- .---- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

Contains new version of Math::BigInt and Math::bigFloat, so please do NOT
make 'make install', except when you do no longer want your old Math::BigInt
or know what you are doing. This rewritten version is mainly compatible, minus
some bugfixes, and more feature and more speed.

To test, unzip & untar package, then run

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install		# as root

These modules will not be installed into the Perl core, but into site-perl.
This means simple usig them will give you still the old versions in your
Perl distribution.

For a quick reference on what has changed from the old versions, please see
CHANGES. HISTORY brings you a detailed history log of the rewrite.

In ./examples are some basic example scripts.

More information including HTMLified help and benchmark results are
available under:

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
