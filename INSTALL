Rewrite project of Math::Big*

(C) Copyright ..--- ----- ----- .---- - ..--- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-

Contains new version of Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat as they are in the
Perl core from v5.8.0 onwards.

This rewritten version is mainly compatible, minus some bugfixes, and more
features and speed.

To test, unzip & untar package, then run

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install		# as root

These modules should be installed automatically into the Perl core, and not
into site-perl. You can check whether you get the old or new versions by doing
this:

	perl -MMath::BigInt -le 'print "v$Math::BigInt::VERSION"'

If it prints undef or v0.01 you still got the old version. Delete the files
from the Perl core installation path manually, and make sure that you 
delete all old versions, then try again to print the version from above. 

For a quick reference on what has changed from the old versions, please see
CHANGES. HISTORY brings you a detailed history log of the rewrite.

In ./examples are some basic example scripts.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
