This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.61) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Calc  : _acmp() is a tad faster (no longer calling _len())
        cleaned up a bit and added some comments
MBI   : fixed the trailing "\n" bug (already in v1.60 in Perl v5.8.0)
	some pod fixed (also already in v5.8.0)
        bround() used (accidentily) internally Math::Big(Float|int) as scale
        pod for is_foo() subs states more explicit that true/false will be
         returned, but not the exact value (0,'',undef or 1/2/3 etc)
MBF   : $x->new("0.02"); $x->accuracy($a); $x->bdiv($y,$d) failed to round
	 when $d > $a
	bsstr() was broken for negative numbers
	numify() used bsstr() and was also broken for negative numbers
	numify('+inf') returned '+inf' and not 'inf'
	as_hex(), as_bin() now work at least for integers, +-inf and NaN
tests : t/*.inc do now use strict;
	MBF: more tests for bsstr/numify/stringify, tests for as_hex/as_bin
	moved some objectify() tests to mbimbf.inc (to run them w/ bare/sub)
        added a test tweak to for is_foo() to let them pass under FastCalc
        added a lot of tests for Calc (_len(), _acmp() etc)
