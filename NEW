This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.56) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Calc  : cap BASE_LEN at 7, not 8, since 64 bit systems fail random tests
MBI   : documented config()
	simplified import() 
	$x->isa($upgrade) => !$x->isa($self) (ditto for ref($x) eq $upgrade)
	one extranous line in bnan() deleted
MBF   : import() did not work on VMS, simplified it
	badd()/bmul() did not upgrade
	config() was missing
tests : testsuite tweaks from Jarkko 
	protect agains non-portable warnings (Jarkko)
	test "Math::BigFloat with =>"

Please have Math::BigInt->new('inf')->bmul('inf') big amounts of fun.
