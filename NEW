This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.53) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Calc  : _div() has shortcut if $y < $MBASE
MBI   : added downgrade()
	typo: precisision vs. precision made Math::BigInt->config() whince
MBF   : numify() on _e in bcmp/bacmp makes these about factor 5.25 faster
	replaced some *= (10 ** $x) places in badd by blsft($x,10) for speed
	(speedup between factor 1 and 3 (up to inf), better for large numbers)
	optimized ffloor() and fceil()
	opt. fpow() (15 vs 16 times is_zero(): between 2 and 15% faster)
	opt. as_number() (replaced "< 0" with "{sign} eq '-'": factor 1..2)
	the fix for bsub (forgot round if $x->bsub(0)) was also present in MBF
	$x->badd(0) forgot to round result
	added downgrade and upgrade to valid methods for inheritance
	new() now downgrades if wanted and possible (e.g. for integers)
tests : added some for bsub((0) and badd(0) bugs
	tests for downgrade
	tests for the _mod() shortcuts

Please have Math::BigInt->new('inf')->bmul('inf') big amounts of fun.
