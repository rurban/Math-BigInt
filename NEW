This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.45) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Calc :  changed the test for the biggest possible BASE_LEN to watch for pattern
	max BASELEN is 8 for now (cheap hack to avoid VMS/OS/390 problems)
	min BASELEN is now 3 (to avoid for OS/390 problems)
	added checks in _check() for correct stringification of parts
	added _mod() for faster $x % $y
MBI  :  John Peacock's patch to add __PACKAGE__ inside accuracy()/precision()
	more tests for mul() to check Calc's BASE_LEN choice
	testsuite skips tests if Calc isn't used, makes it easier for Pari etc
	converted DOS style line-endings to unix in bigflt.inc and Subclass.pm
	bmod() wasn't rounding result afterwards
	bmod() gives now lib a chance to calculate reminder without _div()
	bmod() had no +-inf or NaN handling and was wrong when $y|$x = 0 or 1
	added tests for inf handling in div()
	doc section about reasoning behind NaN and +-inf handling
	reminder => remainder
	bpow() about 15% faster (testet with 2 ** 150, 2 ** 256, 3 ** 127)
	bmod() now a lot faster in almost all cases
MBF  :  fixed bacmp() for $x != +-inf && $y +-inf, added tests for it
tests:  incorporated fix from CORE to find the testing files
	make sure to quote bare floating point values, since stringify might
	 turn 123.46 into 123.459999999 and thus makes the test appear to fail
	more tests in calling.t	
	bigintpm.t now runs it's test in a subclass, too
	tests that expected BASE of 1e5 were changed to use the real BASE
	tests for invalid round_mode()
	various other tests to increase coverage (thanx to Paul Johnson!)

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
