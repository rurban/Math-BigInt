This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.46) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Calc :  added _inc() and _dec() for faster ++ and --
MBI  :  call $CALC->_inc() and $CALC->_dec() for faster ++, --
	don't round twice in bsub() (badd() already rounded), eliminate bneg()
MBF  :  finc()/fdec()/fsub() got similiar treatment like in MBI
	new() streamlined
tests:  added some for _inc()/_dec()
	adapted core changes to make the testsuite run on CPAN and in core
	forgot to quote two floats in mbimbf.t - thus test failed in OS/390

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
