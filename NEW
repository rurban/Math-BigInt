This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.54) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Calc  : started _square() algorithmn
	fixed some comments
MBI   : objectify() disables downgrade 
	(objectify() needs an overhaul since it doesn't work to well with
	 Math::BigFloat due to non-OO-ness)
	Class->upgrade(undef); did not erase $upgrade, ditto for downgrade
	bmul(3,3.5) did not upgrade properly
	bdiv(3,2) did not upgrade properly
	bpow(2,3.5) did not upgrade properly
	is_inf('-inf') didn't work (only is_inf('-'))
	fixed overlong pod items and some assorted pod things
	new() for "simple" (aka /+-[1-9][0-9]*/) numbers is now twice as fast
MBF   : blog() about 20% faster
      : bsqrt() about 10% faster
	$x->bpow($y) w/ $y beeing non-integer hung (now f.i. 2 ** 0.2 works)
	$x ** 0.5 is optimized to bsqrt($x)
tests : some more for blog()
	tests for downgrade/upgrade

Please have Math::BigInt->new('inf')->bmul('inf') big amounts of fun.
