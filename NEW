This lists only the changes for the current release over the last version,
since HISTORY is now quite big:

* Calc.pm supports now Perls with 64 bit integers by using parts with 9
  (opposed to 7) digits. This makes the core math routines like mul, div,
  etc. go faster for huge numbers, since there are less parts to deal with
  and certain operations can use faster variants with only one part.
* fix the warning when the second argument to blog() was a normal scalar
* improve the speed of _log_int() (log integer results) for bases that
  have more than BASE_LEN digits. Instead of incrementally trying until
  we find the result, we compute a guess and use this as the starting
  value
* support config('lib') as an alias for config()->{lib}
* remove outdated and incorrect doc in BigFloat, add some for bexp() and
  bnok()
* BigFloat: mention "common" as round mode
* BigFloat.pm doesn't need to have "Exporter" in @ISA (caused problems with
  the mro patches in blead perl)
* added the bpi($N) method that calculates PI to $N digits
* fix a small problem in BigFloat's import() method that became apparent when
  trying to export the bpi() method
* added the $x->bmuladd($y,$z) method
* add bpi(), bcos(), bsin(), batan() and batan2() methods
* fix overloading for cos/sin/atan2 to use the new methods
