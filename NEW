This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.63) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

MBI   : bsqrt() simulation would not modify $x but return a new object instead
MBF   : bsqrt() would hang on certain inputs (limit was calculated wrong). So
         we switch it to a completely different algorithmn using MBI bsqrt() 
         to calculate the necc. digits based on the observation that
         sqrt(x*y) == sqrt(x) * sqrt(y) and we can set y == 100. This makes it
         also much faster (about factor 10).
        bsqrt(0) would warn and round wrongly to 4 digits. Ditto for bpow,
         blog and bdiv. It is now equivalent to bsqrt(undef).
        removed needless "use File::Spec;"
tests : some more tests for bsqrt() and fsqrt()
        tests for $x->bsqrt(0)/$x->bpow(0) beeing equivalent to $x->bXXX(undef)
	constant.t "no warnings 'portable'" instead of "local $^W = 0;"

Despite the new added tests the testsuite runs now about 15% faster due to the
much improved bsqrt() algorithmn:
