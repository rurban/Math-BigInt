This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.40) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Fixes and enhancements:
  drop leading '+' for inf in bstr(), bsstr() to make $x->binf() eq inf work
  streamlined bcmp() for comparisations with zero
  bxor(-$x,-$y) was broken and not tested for
  bxor(), band(), bior() with negative arguments no longer passed to
  underlying lib (means it works with BitVect, Pari, GMP etc)
 
Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
