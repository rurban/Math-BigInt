This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.48) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

misc :  updated TODO and BUGS
	removed bench/ from dist (see http:/bloodgate.com/perl/bigbench.html)
	fixed examples/bigprime.pl
Calc :  added _sqrt() for more speed
	_sqrt() shortcut for small (< $BASE) numbers for better performance
	shortcut in _mul for small numbers (< $BASE_LEN2)
	added _and, _or, and _xor and let them use more than 16 bits
	find out how many bits _and, _or and _xor can safely use
	div() might leave empty array, so __strip_zeros fixes these
	streamlined _acmp()
MBI  :  fixed pod in many places
	bmod: use round(), not bround()
	bsqrt: use _sqrt() from lib, if possible
	bsqrt: would hang for certain (most?) inputs
	bdiv: slow check for 1 || -1 replaced by much faster version
	bdiv: call _div() only when necc. in list context, otherwise scalar
	streamlined copy(), _find_round_parameters()
	removed the EXPORT_OK except for objectify, _swap and bgcd/blcm
	bzero(), bone(): take additional A and P and store 'em
	bnan(), binf(): clear A and P
MBF  :  fneg() failed (now hand up to MBI)
	frsft() and flsft() were no aliases to brsft() and blsft()
	fone() was no alias for bone()
	blsft() and brsft() were missing altogether
	streamlined: fpow() and fmul()
	removed the EXPORT_OK
	fqsrt() uses now BigInt::bsqrt() as guess: greatly improved performance
	make fsqrt() subclass proof by using $self instead of Math::BigFloat
	bzero(), bone(): take additional A and P and store 'em
	bnan(), binf(): clear A and P
tests:  added some for MBI::bsqrt(), MBF::lfst() and MBF::rsft()
	added extensive tests for band(), bior() and bxor()
	added t/Math/BigInt/BareCalc.pm and run bigint's test trough it

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
