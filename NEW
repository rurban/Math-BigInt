This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.55) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Calc  : fix in _rsft() that left empty instead of containing 0
	fix in _sub with early out that made -1 + 10000000000001 fail
MBI   : Math::BigInt->digit(123) works now 
	:constant recognizes and converts binary and hexadecimal constants
	removed needless statements in bcmp()
MBF   : Math::Bigint::bzero => $MBi->bzero()
	documented the use of 'lib' and 'with'
	added support for use Math::BigFloat with => 'Package';
	use Math::BigFloat lib => 'GMP,Pari' etc works now in various
	combinations with Math::BigInt (e.g. with or without it)
tests : tests for bin/hex :constant 
	tests for the 'lib' and 'with' stuff in MBF

Please have Math::BigInt->new('inf')->bmul('inf') big amounts of fun.
