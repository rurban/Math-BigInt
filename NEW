This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.42) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Fixes and enhancements:
  Fixed serious bug in MBF::bcmp which caused 1.5 to be bigger than 2 *oups*
  fixed $x->length() for $x == 0 in Math::BigFloat
  parts()/mantissa()/exponent() for +-inf/ NaN (failed or returned scalars)
  new('inf') failed (expected '+inf')
  MBF: finf() did not work (only binf() did)
  MBF::bcmp would not only return 0,1,-1 and undef but other values, too
  Bug in MBI overload that caused poor performance for bcmp() of subclasses
  odd numbers can't have trailing 0's, so no conv. necc. for Pari etc
  $CALC->import() w/ list of libs, needed by coming Math::BigInt::Cached
  added as_hex() and as_bin()
  MBF: added tests for length(), parts(), exponent() and mantissa()
  MBI: test for length() in list context

Documentation:
  CAVEAT doc about length in list context (print)
  fixed doc in Math::BigInt::Calc

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
