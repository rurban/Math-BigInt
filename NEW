This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.39) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Fixes and enhancements:
  Some calls to $CALC were not assigning the return value back to $x->{value}
    (This is important when the lib does not modify the args, but returns a
     new value instead; sometimes this is ineviteable)
  Improved infinity handling (complete with tests):
    +-123 / +-inf => 0
    123 / 0 => +inf, -123 / 0 => -inf in MBF
    +inf - +inf = 0, -inf + -inf = 0, -inf - -inf = -inf, +inf + +inf = +inf
    +inf++ or +inf-- => +inf, -inf -- or -inf ++ => -inf
    +inf <=> -inf etc 
    $x->binf()->bstr() => 'inf', not '+inf' (for cmp, eg etc)
  MBF: there were no tests for fdec() and finc()
  MBF: numbers with set precision/accuracy are zero padded
	1234, a=3 => 1230, 1234, a=6 => 1234.00, 123, p=3 => 123.000
  MBI: test for 1234.00 as valid input
  _split() had accidentily 'return return ...', also streamlined it a bit
  Negative inputs in band(), bxor(), bior() and bsrft()/blsft() were broken
  Hexadecimal/binary inputs with underscrores were broken
  
Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
