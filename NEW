This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.69) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Calc :
Emu  : $VERSION was overriding the $VERSION from MBI (Thanx Gisle Aas!)
MBI  : bacmp(+-$x,-inf) was wrong (Thanx William T. Morgan!)
       digit($x,$y) segfaulted under 5.6.1 if $y was a BigInt
       blog() was missing the modify() check (breaking MBI::Constant)
       delete $x->{_a} vs. $x->{_a} = undef to save memory
MBF  : delete $x->{_a} vs. $x->{_a} = undef to save memory
Misc :
tests: more tests for bacmp()

Please have Math::BigInt->new('inf')->bmul('inf') big amounts of fun.
