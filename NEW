Actually changes from 1.33 => 1.35 since 1.34 was never released:

General fixes:
* MBF: A/P rounding after fdiv() was missing
* '-0x0' would wrongly leave '-0'

* fixed MBF::is_zero() for NaN
* added tests for is_odd(), is_even(), _set() and is_zero(), is_inf(),
  bsstr(), is_nan() in both MBI & MBF
* MBF: $x->bpow($y) for negative $y was unfinished
* partially support for +inf/-inf (binf(), is_inf() and string output, tests
* band(), bior(), bxor() were missing modify() and wrong for $x->bfoo(NaN,0);

General additions:
