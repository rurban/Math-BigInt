This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.47) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

Calc :  finished _mod() for the case where $y < $BASE and $BASE % $y != 0
	streamlined _mod() loops a bit
	can do now _pow() for much faster bpow()
	small fix to make v5.005_03 happy
MBI  :  $rnd_mode is back, tests for it (needed for backwards compatibility)
	added overload for %=, |=, &= and ^=
	two places of 'my $t = ... if ...;' => 'my $t; $t = ... if ...;'
	fixed: 1e2e3 isn't a valid number
MBF  :  new() streamlining didn't make it in
        faster new() by making $e += CORE::length(...) only for non zero cases
	replaced the 'laber schwad blah blah' pod section by a pointer to MBI
	$rnd_mode is back, tests for it (needed for backwards compatibility)
tests:  added some for the fixed input cases like 1e3e4
	shortened *.inc testfiles a bit
	completed test for overloaded /.=/ and $x /[+-*/%&|^]/ $y 

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
