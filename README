This package contains new versions of Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat,
so please do NOT make 'make install', except when you do no longer want your
old modules or know what you are doing.

To test, unzip & untar package, then run

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

You can look on CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/) for modules that replace the
core math routines of Math::BigInt (look for Math::BigInt::BitVect, f.i.).
